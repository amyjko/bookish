## Expected behavior

A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

## Actual behavior

Provide detailed steps that consistently reproduce the behavior, including any example code. If you can, make the steps as minimal as possible, finding the smallest possible set of steps that still produce the unexpected behavior.

1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

## Screenshots

If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

## Environment

What platform, OS, browser, and version are you using? Please be exact with version numbers, as different versions can result in a defect happening or not. Don't skip these; cross-browser issues are a common cause of problems.

Desktop

-   OS + version: [e.g. mac OS 14.0]
-   Browser + version [e.g. Chrome 118]

Smartphone

-   Device: [e.g. iPhone6]
-   OS + version: [e.g. iOS 17.1]
-   Browser + version [e.g. Safari]

If you're not reporting an issue on the production site, also describe the environment you are running in (vite dev server, vite build, whether the Firebase emulator is running, whether you're authenticated using the emulator and how.)

# Bookish

Bookish is a simple framework and platforem for publishing online books. I originally created it to make it easier to maintain the many online books on my website (amyjko.com), while adding more sophisticated features to support reading. I'm slowly evolving it to be a simple free online service for authoring and reading online books.

## Project Status

This is very much an alpha that I use for my own book publishing. I have aspirations to make it usable for others in the future. Expect slow progress while I sneak in programming time on evenings and weekends. You can see where I'm headed by reading the issues and Backend project, which are somewhat organized.

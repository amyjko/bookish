# Bookish

Bookish is a framework and platform for writing and publishing web-based books. I originally created it to make it easier to maintain the many online books on my website (amyjko.com), while adding more sophisticated features to support reading. I'm slowly evolving it to be a simple free online service for authoring and reading online books.

## Status

I'm working on a beta launch of the platform at [bookish.press](https://bookish.press) and expect to maintain the platform for the foreseeable future. Let me know if you'd like to help!

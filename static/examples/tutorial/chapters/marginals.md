...whenever we hear the promises of tech being extolled, our antennae should pop up to question what all the hype of “better, faster, fairer” might be hiding and making us ignore. And when bias and inequity come to light, “lack of intention” to harm is not a viable alibi. One cannot reap the reward when things go right but downplay the responsibility when they go wrong.

To many<swearngin20>, computers, software, and the computer science that shapes them are things of wonder. They’ve transformed how we stay connected with friends, families, and colleagues from around the world. They’ve enabled entirely new social and media experiences in video games, the internet, television, and movies. 

* They have led to dramatic increases in convenience for many, making it possible to order nearly anything online, or to easily catch a ride home or to the airport<swearngin200>.
* Computers<swearngin201> are also transforming science and scholarship, accelerating discoveries in health, wellness, and energy. This new world of computing is, for so many, one of magic, possibility, and change.

Throughout this book, we’ve discussed numerous aspects of computing: the difference between design and engineering, the nature of intelligence and information, the history of computers and operating systems, and the major elements of programming languages, including their notations, their decision making features, and their ways of representing information as dta. All of these, while foundational, are all in service of a central idea in computing: *algorithms*{The word algorithm originally came from the name of Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi<swearngin20>, who wrote extensively about number systems and algebra in the 8th and 9th centuries. When his work was translated to Latin, his name was translated to “Algorizmi”, which the English later changed to “algorism”, used to mean “decimal number system”. It was this sense that was appropriated by English mathematicians, and eventually Lovelace, who offered its modern usage as “procedure”<latoza20>.}.

	"description": "Teaching is hard, especially in higher education, where few people have a formal training in learning, teaching, or education. I wrote this book to support the teachers in the University of Washington Information school who lack training in teaching, providing a personal, but also evidence-based understanding of teaching and learning. It shouldn't take more than 1 hour to read, and should provide the knowledge you need to structure your practice as a teacher.\n\nI hope you enjoy! If not, please file an [issue|https://github.com/amyjko/informatics-teaching-guide/issues/new] on the book's [GitHub repository|https://github.com/amyjko/informatics-teaching-guide/].",
